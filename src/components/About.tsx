      <p>
        <u>Hi! I'm Garett</u>. I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> based in{" "}
        <b>Brooklyn, NY</b>. When I was a kid living upstate, I was always
        fascinated by technology, and I've been creating web pages since 2003.
        Taking that enthusiasm into my work, I'm passionate about crafting great{" "}
        <b>user experiences</b>, ensuring <b>accessible applications</b>, and
        writing code that's easy to read and <b>scalable</b> for organizations
        looking to grow. My goal is always to create applications that not only
        look great, but are also usable, performant, and secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked with a variety of companies in both the public and private
        sectors. I believe that communication is key to the success of a
        project, and I work closely with clients to ensure their needs are heard
        and met through the software I deliver.

        I also compose music, develop video games, write comedy sketches, and
        hang out with my cat.
