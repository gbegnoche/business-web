      <p>
        <u>Game Jams</u> are video game development events where participants
        design and code a game from scratch, typically over the course of a
        weekend, with a specific theme or set of constraints to inspire
        creativity. Game jams are a great way to experiment, learn, and showcase
        development skills in a fast-paced, fun environment.

        Unless otherwise noted, all code was written by me. I also handled game
        design, project management, music, and sound design.
